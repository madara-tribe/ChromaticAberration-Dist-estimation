1 check psycal sysmtom following paper 
- create color filter
- calcurate R G B Transmittance ratio

2 confirm the meaning of formula b = (a*vf/2p)(1/f -1/vf - 1/x) ((size of chromatic aberration))

- take photos and check b value depending on distance -N ~ M
- take eadge detection and confirm rgb's each chromatic aberration
  => now here is end of the first step
