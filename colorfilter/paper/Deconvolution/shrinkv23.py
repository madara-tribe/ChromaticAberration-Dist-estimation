"""
Explanation:
Precomputation and Setup:
k, m, v2, v3, v4, m2, and m3 are computed to set up the coefficients for the quartic equation.
alpha and beta2 are calculated based on v and beta.
Quartic Equation Roots Calculation:
r1 is computed for solving the cubic equation.
u is computed as the cubic root of r1.
W is computed from alpha and y.
Roots Computation:
Four potential roots are calculated using alpha, beta2, and W.
Selection of the Best Root:
root_flag3 filters out invalid roots and chooses the best one based on criteria.
Return Value:
w is the final result which is selected based on the filtered roots.
Note:

Ensure you have numpy installed in your Python environment. If not, install it using pip install numpy.
The example values for v and beta are placeholders. Replace them with your actual data for practical use.
Adjust the handling of v, especially if it's a multi-dimensional array, based on your specific needs.
